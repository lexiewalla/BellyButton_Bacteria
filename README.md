# BellyButton_Bacteria
module 12 javascript


## Overview

In this module we used javascript to build an interactive wesbite that shows the different bacteria found in participants. A meat company conducted a study to try to find a new way to create meatless meat. The website displays all demographic information when you select a participant and shows the bacteria found within each.  There are several charts to show the frequency of washes, the different types of bacteria and a scatter plot that shows the amount of bacteria found in each sample. The charts will change based on the selected participant. Below is an overview of the dashboard.
